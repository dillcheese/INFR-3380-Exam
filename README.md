# INFR-3380-Exam

My Duck based controoler is shaped after a rubber ducky. It's components simply consist of an Arduino, breadboard, 3 buttons and a vibration board as well as the shell of the controller.

The simulation simply shows the buttons for controlling the duck character (one to move up, one to move down and the other for the action, which gives the duck 0.25 seconds of invincibilty when they use it and cna only be used once per game). THe components I chose were simply 3 pushbuttons to represent the controller buttons and a a vibration motor which vibrates when hte player uses the action.
